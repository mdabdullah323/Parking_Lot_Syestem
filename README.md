# Project Title: Parking Lot System using Python OOP

## Project Description:
- As part of my studies in Python, I developed a Parking Lot System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
- The project allows users to park their vehicles and track their parking duration and fees. 
- The system includes classes for the parking lot, vehicles, users, and parking transactions.

## The Parking Lot System includes the following features:

1. Parking Lot Class: This class includes the name of the parking lot and the number of parking spaces available in it. It also has methods to reserve a parking space, check for available parking spaces, and calculate parking fees.

2. Vehicle Class: This class includes the type of vehicle, the license plate number, and the arrival time.

3. User Class: This class includes the name and contact details of the user who is parking the vehicle.

4. Parking Transaction Class: This class includes the details of the parking transaction, such as the vehicle parked, the user who parked the vehicle, the parking duration, and the parking fees.

I developed this project using Python OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. I also used Python libraries such as datetime to track the parking duration and calculate fees. I gained experience in software design and development, testing, and debugging. Overall, this project helped me strengthen my Python programming skills and understanding of OOP concepts.
