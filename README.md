# Project Title: Cinema Hall Reservation System using Python OOP

### Project Description:

- As part of my studies in Python, I developed a Cinema Hall Reservation System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
- The project allows users to reserve seats for movies in a cinema hall.  
- The system includes classes for the cinema hall, movies, users, and reservations, and it enables users to select the movie, the date and time of the show, and reserve seats in the cinema hall.

### The Cinema Hall Reservation System includes the following features:

1. Cinema Hall Class: This class includes the name of the cinema hall and the number of seats available in it. It also has a method to reserve seats in the cinema hall.

2. Movie Class: This class includes the name of the movie, show timings, and the cinema hall where the movie is being screened.

3. User Class: This class includes the name and contact details of the user who is reserving the seats.

4. Reservation Class: This class includes the details of the reservation, such as the movie selected, the number of seats reserved, the user who made the reservation, and the date and time of the show.

- I developed this project using Python OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- I also used Python libraries such as datetime and random to generate dates and reservation IDs. 
- I gained experience in software design and development, testing, and debugging. Overall, this project helped me strengthen my Python programming skills and understanding of OOP concepts.
